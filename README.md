# Task Management API

A simple task management API built with Node.js. This system has been "running in production" and users are reporting issues.

## Exercise

Your production monitoring has flagged some errors. The logs are in the `logs/` folder.

**Your workflow:**
1. Read the log files - identify what's going wrong
2. Fix the bug

There are 3 bugs at different difficulty levels. Pick one based on your confidence:
- `error-2024-01-20.log` - Start here if unsure
- `frontend-2024-01-21.log` - Medium difficulty
- `monitoring-2024-01-22.log` - Harder, requires understanding async patterns

**Note:** All tests currently pass. That's why these bugs made it to production!

## Setup

```bash
npm test        # Run tests (53 passing)
npm run dev     # Start server on port 3000
```

No dependencies required - uses Node.js built-in modules only.
